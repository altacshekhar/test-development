    body_text: <p>As the saying goes, bread is indeed life. Did you know that in many cultures, bread is still a metaphor for wealth? Bread has, in fact, for a long time now been another name for "money". Consider this – a person who works to support his/her family is known as the "breadwinner".</p><br><p>Bread is, therefore, something many of us cannot do without. It is, for lack of a better word, a basic requirement, just like money. That is why you will find bread in almost every meal consumed in many parts of the world, including America. It is believed that on average, the usual American consumes about 53 pounds of bread every single year.</p><p>Outback Steakhouse is famous for its steak, which is great by the way. But if you still believe that steaks and ribs are the best it has to offer, you obviously haven’t tried its honey wheat bread! Follow this recipe to the letter and you will finally understand what this hype is all about. Good luck!<br></p>
