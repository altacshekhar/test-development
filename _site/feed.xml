Sure, you can control it, but most restaurant managers simply focus on the hours paid and don’t appreciate the myriad ways you can impact your labor cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions with our clients we have developed these four simple strategies to improve your labor control by more than just remembering to cut labor when it’s slow. While the schedule itself is crucial to successful labor management, you can’t assume that it’s enough to get your labor costs under control. So, enjoy these peer-built best practices and save money by implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-overtime--other-pay-overages&quot;&gt;Reduce Overtime &amp;amp; Other Pay Overages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wage and overtime costs can be a big strain on your restaurant’s budget. We’ve used part-time employees and temp workers to assuage the issue, but that can only go so far. For example, a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/online-schedule-maker.html&quot;&gt;ZipShedules&lt;/a&gt; can alert you when you have a team member that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/overtime-laws.html&quot;&gt;approaching the overtime threshold&lt;/a&gt;. That allows you to respond before the fact rather paying the premium after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your team riding the clock and being paid for time they aren’t actually working (whether on purpose or not) can be an easily avoided expense. By integrating your scheduling software into your POS, you can control when a staff member can clock in, so they can’t do it early – unless you direct them. Also, you can better reflect staff breaks to ensure everyone gets a rest, but no one takes advantage of your business when they do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review--adjust-current-compensation-plans&quot;&gt;Review &amp;amp; Adjust Current Compensation Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By evaluating our companies’ salaries, wages, and benefits, we found several opportunities where restaurants can cut costs. Using websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;GlassDoor&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to ensure we weren’t over- or underpaying our staff by comparing our pay to the average market value for a comparable restaurant. When we found a slight overage, it was much easier to keep track of and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/business-tips-best-ways-manage-hourly-employees.html&quot;&gt;scale down with our new hires&lt;/a&gt;, so we were closer to market level. We also implemented revenue-driven pay raises, so our top servers were more accurately and properly compensated when the time came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-labor-costs-by-optimizing-schedules&quot;&gt;Reduce Labor Costs by Optimizing Schedules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know this challenge all too well. Either you end up overscheduling for a shift that ends up being slow or under-scheduling for a busy shift that puts everyone in the weeds. It is a nightmare on both ends that can kill your margins or hurt your guests’ experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help stave off this issue, we started using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/online-schedule-maker.html&quot;&gt;employee scheduling software&lt;/a&gt; that can labor forecast when we input our old POS sales data and employee availabilities. This way, we schedule the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/online-schedule-generator.html&quot;&gt;correct number of employees for the shift&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to this, we were able to cut down on overscheduling and had far fewer shifts where we were unexpectedly short staffed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-employee-turnover&quot;&gt;Reduce Employee Turnover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing an employee is awful; it also hurts your budget significantly. Spending countless hours interviewing, training, and correcting mistakes made by new hires is avoidable if you focus on staff retention. It’s as simple as keeping your &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/6-unique-employee-training-methods-work.html&quot;&gt;team happy and well trained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started more heavily cross-training in order to grow our legacy employees’ skill sets. This allows staff members to be more flexible and cover more than one position (when needed). We also empowered them to train newer team members on their skills, which in turn, saves our management their ever-so-valuable time! Cross-training also gives us the added bonus of not having to rush to replace employees if one does leave. It makes for a more successful and sustainable business. This new model combined with our new scheduling software saved us so much time and money we don’t know how we ever were able to do it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these four best practices represent opportunities to improve your labor controls, it still always comes down to the schedule. By creating, deploying and managing a great schedule, you can avoid most of the labor cost pitfalls you will face. That’s where great software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/online-schedule-maker.html&quot;&gt;ZipSchedules&lt;/a&gt; fills an obvious need. The software improves your minute to minute awareness of labor issues while ensuring you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipschedules.com/16-reasons-you-need-employee-scheduling-software.html&quot;&gt;predict and prepare better&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming work week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these best practices will help you even further refine your costs, so your profit can soar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the real world might have these moments of managerial magic, they’re mitigated by the fact that employees are, well, human. They get frustrated. They feel overlooked, undervalued and slighted. When you mix in the stress of required productivity, you’ve got a recipe for interoffice conflict that’s up to you to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robynshort.com/2016/02/16/the-cost-of-conflict-in-the-workplace/&quot;&gt;Data gathered by trained mediator Robyn Short&lt;/a&gt; has found that “U.S. employees spend 2.1 hours per week involved with conflict, which amounts to approximately $359 billion in paid hours.” Even worse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;85 percent of employees deal with conflict on some level&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;29 percent of employees deal with it almost constantly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25 percent of employees have seen conflict result in sickness or absence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9 percent have seen workplace conflict cause a project to fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you avoid the negative effects of conflict without derailing your own productivity as a manager? Here are the conflict resolution styles all managers need to master:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-self-awareness&quot;&gt;Start with Self-Awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management, in general, requires the ability to thoughtfully analyze your performance and make improvements where you see shortcomings. The area of conflict resolution is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve both your self-awareness and your skills in handling conflict, get in the habit of regularly asking yourself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am I handling conflict using the right tools?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is my &lt;a href=&quot;https://hubworks.com/6-management-styles.html&quot;&gt;management style&lt;/a&gt; creating conflict on my team?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How comfortable am I having tough conversations with employees?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am I proposing useful solutions in the event of conflict?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do employees feel confident in my ability to manage their conflicts?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am I creating an environment where conflict thrives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions don’t have easy answers, and you may find that your responses vary day to day. By regularly asking them of yourself, you’ll identify opportunities to grow in your ability to manage conflict on your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-willing-to-confront-conflict&quot;&gt;Be Willing to Confront Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you evaluate your managerial skills, keep in mind that one of your most valuable tools as a manager is the willingness to confront conflict when you see it occurring. It sounds simple, but the reality is that most of us would rather bury our heads in the sand - avoiding any acknowledgement that things are wrong or that people are unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a mistake, whether you’re avoiding conflict from the get-go or not following through on the resolutions you’ve attempted to put in place. On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/workplace-conflict-resolution-1918675&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Balance blog&lt;/a&gt;, Susan M. Heathfield shares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Even if the conflict appears to have been superficially put to rest, it will rear its ugly head whenever stress increases or a new disagreement occurs. An unresolved conflict or interpersonal disagreement festers just under the surface in your work environment. It burbles to the surface whenever enabled, and always at the worst possible moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to improve this skill is to make a habit of checking in with yourself. As much as your mind might try to shy away from the problem at hand, your gut won’t let you forget. Tune in regularly to identify conflicts that need your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;know-when-to-take-action&quot;&gt;Know When to Take Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some trivial conflicts - like personality clashes - don’t require a heavy managerial touch. But a workplace will always have issues that need a manager who can step up to the plate and resolve tension or confusion quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/ways-to-manage-conflict-2276062&quot;&gt;four conflict resolution styles&lt;/a&gt; will help you assess and address common workplace issues, so you and your employees can get back to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the collaborating conflict resolution style is to find a win-win solution. If you have department heads competing for resources and budget talks have ground to a halt, for example, it might be prudent to bring everyone together to generate consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start off by finding some common ground, suggests PR consultant Angela Stringfellow at the American Express Open Forum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/5-strategies-for-managing-workplace-conflicts/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No matter how significant a conflict or how drastic differences of opinion are, there’s almost always something you can find on which the two employees in conflict can agree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you may have to set ground rules or approve the final decision, set your employees up for success by giving them the tools they need to negotiate fairly with one another to find a workable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compromising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we can’t get what we want out of a situation - and you may even have to ask team members to compromise their expectations around timelines, budgets, and other company resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business, compromise isn’t always the best answer - but it can help you buy time and take baby steps toward finding a solution that will make everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/when-to-compromise-2013-10&quot;&gt;when you should compromise at work&lt;/a&gt; at Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accommodating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accommodating conflict resolution style is inherently passive. Essentially, one of the parties involved in the conflict will simply accede to the demands of the other party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a managerial position, this style can be dangerous. A boss needs to be a firm and assertive decisionmaker, even if it occasionally makes others unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A competing conflict resolution style forces the other party to acquiesce to your demands. Of course, there will be times as a manager when you need to hold the company line - especially in issues of policy or strategy that are out of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are alternatives to using this strategy all the time. Consider how regular employee feedback and setting workplace boundaries can help you avoid conflict and cultivate a happier, more productive workplace atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cultivate-a-culture-of-feedback&quot;&gt;Cultivate a Culture of Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conflict resolution - as in so many things - be the example you want to see. How can you expect your employees to react to your critiques if you’ve shown that your ears are closed to similar criticisms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective management is driven by an openness to giving and receiving feedback. &amp;lt;a href=”https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/06/07/five-conflict-management-strategies/#1933b1de521d”Forbes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; contributor Laura Berger suggests the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ask your team for their frequent, healthy feedback, and you will begin to show boldness and encourage transparency through your example. Allowing unpleasant truths to trickle out gradually fosters a sense of camaraderie and understanding within your organization, in turn reducing the risk of future conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting you open yourself up for an office free-for-all. Put boundaries around how feedback will be shared, received and acted upon to ensure you receive feedback that’s helpful - not vindictive. Then, prove to your team that you’re willing to make changes by implementing the recommendations suggested by your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you model this behavior yourself, the more your employees will start adopting it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-firm-boundaries&quot;&gt;Set Firm Boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cold, hard truth is that, sometimes, conflicts will be beyond your ability to resolve. You can’t help everybody, and certain employees’ personalities, traits or conflicts may grow so large that resolution isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting boundaries prevents these situations from continuing longer than they need to. For instance, you may need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set defined performance expectations for employees that they may be unable to meet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Absolve yourself from responsibility for team members who won’t assist in resolving their conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terminate employees who continually perpetuate conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these are easy lines to draw, but good management means not letting employees define them for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reframe-your-understanding-of-workplace-conflict&quot;&gt;Reframe Your Understanding of Workplace Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171208---Blog-Assets6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let go of the idea that all workplace conflict can be resolved. In fact, start to think of it as a good thing. As Tamara Lytle, writing for SHRM, describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Experts have found that the most effective teams are those in which members feel safe enough to disagree with one another. A culture where dissent is allowed, or even encouraged, can spur innovation, diversity of thought and better decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to distinguish between productive and toxic conflict, and you’ll be able to leverage the benefits Lytle highlights without the downsides emphasized by Robyn Short’s earlier data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers should also provide employees with clearly-articulated performance metrics that reflect relevant changes to their roles, and address these changes prior to an annual review.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hubworks</name></author><summary type="html">In an ideal world, managing employees would involve motivating them to bring their best selves to work, encouraging a harmonious environment with teams working together to advance the company.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hubworks.com/Hubworks-171208---Blog-AssetsMain-Article-Image-copy.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">8 Steps for an Effective Change Management Process</title><link href="https://hubworks.com/change-management-process.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="8 Steps for an Effective Change Management Process" /><published>2017-12-01T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-12-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://hubworks.com/eight-steps-for-an-effective-change-management-process</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hubworks.com/change-management-process.html">&lt;p&gt;Whether you run a tech startup that keeps pace with visionaries in Silicon Valley, or a small business, major change at
the company level requires an extra managerial touch. This can be especially true if you’re helping your company weather
big shifts in direction, like coming under new ownership or undergoing a rebranding effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a survey conducted by McKinsey and Company, as many as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2017/07/25/1-reason-why-most-change-management-efforts-fail/#2a1e2a94546b&quot;&gt;“70% of change efforts fail during the transition period”&lt;/a&gt;. And they fail for all sorts of reasons, too - from poor
communication to underbaked visions that make employees balk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While plenty can be said for the importance of leadership and communication during a major transition, research from the
Harvard Business Review suggests that change efforts must also be guided with concrete benchmarks - or “hard factors” -
in order to be truly successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some of the hard factors that affect a transformation initiative are the time necessary to complete it, the number of
people required to execute it, and the financial results that intended actions are expected to achieve,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2005/10/the-hard-side-of-change-management&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the study’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing concrete deadlines and articulating financial goals, in addition to managing employee attitudes and
behaviors, is the ultimate recipe for change management success. Using these principles, we’ve outlined 8 steps for an
effective process to help take you where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-identify-the-scope-of-change&quot;&gt;1. Identify the scope of change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some changes seem intuitive. For example, after a bad Q3, it’s essential to take stock and establish better strategies
for hitting your sales benchmarks in Q4. It just makes sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major transitions in a business demand the same care and strategy on a larger scale - and often come with extra hurdles
around employee behavior, company resources, and communication. Buy-in isn’t always easy to generate, especially if
you’re making major changes to workflow, restructuring departments, or introducing a new product or mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you announce a major change initiative to all employees, it’s best to identify the scope of change your
organization will tackle. Here are a few questions to prompt you and your leadership board as you outline the new vision
for your company or department:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needs to change? Why? What data do you have to back up your observations? Who will this change affect on your team?
What resources will they need in place to deal with the change? How will the change affect your customers? What is the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified the shift your company needs to make, begin the process of strategizing how the transition will
roll out. Before you talk to your employees, you’ll need to know the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does “change” look like? How long will it take? What are the costs? What are your new benchmarks for success and
how will you measure them? What are the leadership roles needed for this transition? How and when will employees be
informed of the change? When will re-training take place? What forms of employee feedback will be relevant to this
process and when will you collect them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating openly with your team about forthcoming changes from the get-go can help generate buy-in, especially if
employees know their feedback will be considered. On the flip side, failing to communicate company-wide challenges with
your entire team can stall progress and even prevent change from happening, warns Mark Murphy, founder of LeadershipIQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If challenges create a sense of urgency for change, then [data from Leadership IQ] clearly shows that the majority of
leaders are doing a poor job of explaining those challenges,” Murphy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/06/05/this-chart-shows-why-so-many-change-management-efforts-fail/# 7ae67d0771fe&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; at Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In fact, only 35% of leaders are ‘Always’ or ‘Frequently’ sharing challenges, and that means that nearly two-thirds of
leaders are missing this essential ingredient of change management,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will you communicate challenges - and potential changes - internally to harness the know-how of your team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-put-your-leadership-team-in-place&quot;&gt;3. Put your leadership team in place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change management has to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2015/08/25/how-effective-leaders-keep-change-management-programs-on-track/ #62b65bd21253&quot;&gt;come from the top&lt;/a&gt;. Without a CEO driving the company’s new vision of the future, employees are less
likely to hop on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, according to management expert Ray Gagnon, no successful leader can manage company-wide changes alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Your] job as a change agent is to win over a “coalition” to help you move your change program forward,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ray-gagnon/effective-change-manageme_b_2993527.html&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; Gagnon at
Huffington Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you are a CEO, your coalition would typically be drawn first from your leadership team. But don’t forget to look
more broadly to thought-leaders, key influencers and subject experts elsewhere in the company,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubworks.com/6-management-styles.html&quot;&gt;company leadership&lt;/a&gt; - department
directors, managers, and assistant managers - should all have concrete roles in the transition to help address specific
needs across departments, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-establish-new-benchmarks&quot;&gt;4. Establish new benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you consult with your leadership team or generate employee feedback on process first, management will need to
establish and communicate clear new benchmarks for performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of “The Hard Side of Change Management,” these new benchmarks should be closely related to
day-to-day performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Scheduling milestones and assessing their impact are the best way by which executives can review the execution of
projects, identify gaps, and spot new risks,” the study’s authors write. “The most effective milestones are those that
describe major actions or achievements rather than day-to-day activities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows senior management to effectively track performance and readjust strategy on the fly. Since effective change
management is as much about behavior as strategy, employees will need to know which of their behaviors or ideas will
have to shift, too. Should your employees approach their day-to-day tasks differently to be successful at reaching the
new targets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-share-change-strategy-or-vision&quot;&gt;5. Share change strategy or vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a vision for the future in place, it’s important to communicate clearly and often with the entire company
about the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the initial announcement of a new company mission, or a memo detailing a new product line, for example,
continue communicating frequently with your employees about the change and how it will affect their roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to provide plenty of opportunities for employees to provide feedback during this process. Feedback can be
granular - a list of frequent customer questions that arise during sales or support calls, for example - or big picture.
Open-door policies for managers, employee town halls, or surveys can help give managers a better picture of how the
changes are rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you prepare your internal communication strategy, consider that your employees will most likely want to know the
following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What problems have you identified that led to the need for change? What’s your vision of the future? What resources have
you put in place to help your employees deal with the change? What are your new expectations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-provide-resources&quot;&gt;6. Provide resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change doesn’t happen overnight - and your team will most likely need resources to help them through the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More regular check-ins from management, encouragement in meetings or on productivity tools like Slack, and all-staff
meetings can be designed to give employees the extra feedback and behavioral reinforcement they need to weather serious
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also pair these extra touches with concrete resources: an increased budget for training and education
that helps employees meet new expectations, for example, or more flexibility for departments to identify and purchase
any new tools needed to complete their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers should also provide employees with clearly-articulated performance metrics that reflect relevant changes to
their roles, and address these changes prior to an annual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-communicate--ask-for-feedback&quot;&gt;7. Communicate &amp;amp; ask for feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your company transitions, remember that your employees - and your leadership team - will require more frequent
communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perry Keenan, the managing director of Boston Consulting Group, suggests using the rule of “three and nine” during
transition. Communicate three times more often than seems necessary, says Keenan, and recognize that it may take up to
nine repetitions for an employee to understand that a change in procedure affects their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it might seem like a lot of communication, Keenan says this strategy isn’t overkill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leaders tend to shy away from ‘over-communicating,’ but repetition can help make a change initiative ubiquitous and in
time a regular and accepted part of the new business as usual,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2015/08/25/how-effective-leaders-keep-change-management-programs-on-track/ 2/#60df36ef6787&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may even consider holding periodic community meetings or surveys to collect employee feedback to address unforeseen
issues during the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-measure-progress&quot;&gt;8. Measure progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171201---Blog-Assets8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the transition period, measure the progress your team is making against new benchmarks. Is your team or your
company where you wanted it to be at the 6-month mark of the transition? The year mark?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, what concrete measures can you put in place to bring everyone up to speed? Take time to reflect with your
leadership team on what the transition’s status may tell you about employee morale or other hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: all of your employees may not actually be on board with whatever changes your company is tackling - even after
several months have passed. And while some of them may come around, it’s up to you to nip outsize negativity in the bud
before it affects your whole team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be afraid to be direct,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/eric-morgan/5-tips-for-effectively-managing-change.html&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; Eric Morgan, the CEO of
Workfront, at Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Morgan, sitting down with a negative employee and saying, “‘It’s been 3 months now, and you’re not getting
there. Are you going to get there? Or do we need to talk about other options for you?’” will signal that change is here
to stay - and the employee needs to get on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change management isn’t easy - but weathering the storm isn’t an option. Use these strategies to develop strong
workplace communication and boost company morale if you have a big change coming your way in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hubworks</name></author><summary type="html">Whether you run a tech startup that keeps pace with visionaries in Silicon Valley, or a small business, major change at the company level requires an extra managerial touch.

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2016/01/26/5-proven-ways-to-improve-your-companys-communication/#4edefd773118&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, “Companies with effective communication strategies have 47% higher returns to shareholders, more engaged employees, and less employee turnover.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, communications-savvy companies can actually translate these effective strategies into dollars saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barriers that lead to misunderstandings between leadership and employees cause massive losses in productivity, especially if errors lead to poor or delayed decision-making. In fact, the cumulative cost of communication breakdowns is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/10-ways-to-improve-internal-communication.html&quot;&gt;$26,041 per worker per year&lt;/a&gt; - what amounts to a sizable chunk of an employee’s annual salary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let poor communication keep your employees from reaching their full potential. These 8 tried-and-true strategies - grounded in neuroscience, workplace design, and psychology - will help your team communicate more effectively than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-offer-supportive-feedback&quot;&gt;1. Offer Supportive Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some level, every good manager knows feedback on an employee’s performance should be constructive. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/10-ways-to-improve-internal-communication.html&quot;&gt;28% of employees&lt;/a&gt; indicate they never receive recognition or praise in their roles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a natural-born cheerleader or mentor, it may be time to rethink how you dish out feedback - and how you encourage other team members to communicate with one another by extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to neurologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolkinseygoman/2016/08/12/10-change-management-strategies-that-are-backed-by-science/2/#696398253f8e&quot;&gt;Carol Kinsey Goman&lt;/a&gt;, exclusivity or neglect produces the same chemical as physical pain - which makes inclusivity, collaboration, and trust a beneficial component of any workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing regular, supportive feedback - even in small, digital ways - makes employees feel valued and supported, increasing productivity and engagement in their roles. Take the time to give a quick thumbs up on Slack, or set a reminder for yourself to check in informally at your employee’s workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a broader level, regularly review your management style or ask for anonymous employee feedback. Are you providing constructive criticism on projects in process? Are you allowing employees to complete their tasks with relative autonomy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537750774/is-your-boss-too-controlling-many-employees-clash-with-micromanagers&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of trust inherent in micromanaging - whether exhibited in subtle or not-so-subtle ways - increases dissatisfaction in roles, lowers employee morale, and elevates stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need employees who will do more than do what they’re told, employees who will think for themselves, who will be creative, who will try new approaches,” executive coach Steve Motenko &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537750774/is-your-boss-too-controlling-many-employees-clash-with-micromanagers&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the broadcast service, “and all of that is squashed by micromanaging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you can build trust through supportive forms of feedback, the more productive your employees will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-keep-it-quiet-keep-it-simple&quot;&gt;2. Keep it Quiet, Keep it Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While open-plan offices can increase circulation and cross-team communication, the noise that comes along with knocking down office walls can increase distraction and decrease productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average American office worker is interrupted every 11 minutes - but it can take as many as 23 minutes to regain concentration, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7456-workspace-design-productivity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business News Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because workers are so prone to distraction, it’s up to their managers to make it easier for them to digest complicated information, Goman suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The prefrontal cortex can only deal well with a few concepts at a time…Your job is to help people make sense of complexity by condensing it into two or three critical goals that they can understand and absorb,” Goman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolkinseygoman/2016/08/12/10-change-management-strategies-that-are-backed-by-science/#12c7cdd12bd6&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; at Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for helping your team manage day-to-day distractions? Headphones, white noise machines, and quiet work spaces can all produce &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/10-minute-trick-to-boost-your-productivity-2016-1&quot;&gt;happier, more productive workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-move-around&quot;&gt;3. Move Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/10/workspaces-that-move-people&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; reported that workspaces designed for exploration, engagement, and energy increased not only communication but problem-solving in team members. Researchers tracked employee usage of physical office space in multiple sectors - from pharma to finance - then tied the data to performance outcomes, including sales and product launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Our] data suggest that creating collisions - chance encounters and unplanned interactions between knowledge workers, both inside and outside the organization - improves performance,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/10/workspaces-that-move-people&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Ben Waber, Jennifer Magnolfi, and Greg Lindsay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it might take some planning - and investment - to design a highly-functional workspace worthy of Silicon Valley, Waber, Magnolfi, and Lindsay offer compelling evidence that good office design is directly related to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your physical space isn’t conducive to communication - or an office upgrade isn’t in the budget - try to incorporate the value of “collision” into other aspects of your team culture. Design team projects with members from different departments, for example. The key here is to break down communication silos and further encourage team-building - even if the “collisions” are slightly manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-balance-digital--in-person-communication&quot;&gt;4. Balance Digital &amp;amp; In-Person Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the influx of team and project management tools like Slack, Basecamp, and Asana, it’s tempting to limit opportunities for circulation and in-person communication in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Waber, Magnolfi, and Lindsay also discovered that in-person communication enhances the effectiveness of digital tools. Digital tools simply can’t replace in-person communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing a remote team, this may be a reason to encourage your workers to seek out co-working spaces, argue the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People who chose to work in those spaces intentionally sought members from different organizations, thus reproducing the community, social interaction, learning, and energy typical of their online work, while adding the benefit of physical proximity to others,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/10/workspaces-that-move-people&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Waber, Magnolfi and Lindsay in Harvard Business Review. “Unwittingly, they were engineering spaces to create the exploration that we know enhances creativity. And it worked.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you manage a remote team or rely on digital tools to keep your employees on track, “going digital” in the 21st century workplace can’t erase the vital importance of in-person collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever received a memo from the company CEO and just felt, well, confused?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not alone - a majority of employees who don’t understand company strategy feel disconnected from their roles, and that’s a big problem for work culture, according to two researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Employees need to hear from senior managers themselves - through straight talk, and ideally in reciprocal exchanges, so that workers feel their own views are heard,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/12/how-to-help-employees-get-strategy&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; Charles Galunic and Immanuel Hermreck at Harvard Business Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s a direct relationship between an employee’s understanding of their role in a company and their productivity. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/10-ways-to-improve-internal-communication.html&quot;&gt;Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, 91% of employees will work for success when they understand how their role relates to company strategy - and that understanding hinges on direct communication from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more compelling: an employee’s ability to understand a company’s mission or a CEO’s vision can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust&quot;&gt;reduce stress and increase trust&lt;/a&gt; between workers and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a leadership position, provide all employees with clear, transparent goals for their individual roles, their department’s role in the company, and the company’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just communicating with your direct reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/12/how-to-help-employees-get-strategy&quot;&gt;won’t cut it&lt;/a&gt; - you need to make yourself available to regular team members for the efforts to be felt at the company level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-break-down-silos&quot;&gt;6. Break Down Silos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the bad news: communication silos caused by mismanagement and lack of top-down communication or inter-departmental communication directly impact ROI and decrease employee productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“According to a study by Cognisco, the mistakes that can happen as a result of miscommunication cost approximately $37 billion a year,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2014/10/02/employee-alignment-the-secret-sauce-to-success/#75ccc5f4e024&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; Kate Harrison at Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - what’s the cure? Give your teams more autonomy to collaborate and make decisions, increasing trust, suggests one researcher at Harvard Business Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In my research I’ve found that building a culture of trust is what makes a meaningful difference [between high- and low-turnover companies],” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-neuroscience-of-trust&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; neuroeconomist Paul J. Zak. “Employees in high-trust organizations are more productive, have more energy at work, collaborate better with their colleagues, and stay with their employers longer than people working at low-trust companies. They also suffer less chronic stress and are happier with their lives, and these factors fuel stronger performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to increase both trust and collaboration on your team or between departments? Use digital tools to speed up the time between identifying a project, product, or problem area and decision-making, encouraging teams to collaborate with one another in real time. The autonomy to move forward on a project will engender the kind of trust Zak researches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-ditch-meetings&quot;&gt;7. Ditch Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to give up after taking a look at your calendar - and then your to-do list - you’ll feel vindicated by this next suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show that an over-reliance on meetings can waste both time and human resources. This leads to employee dissatisfaction and increased stress from unmanageable workloads - which employees often opt to take on during personal time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Excessive] meetings force people to make trade-offs concerning how and when to accomplish their solo work,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Leslie Perlow, Constance Noonan Hadley, and Eunice Eun at Harvard Business Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes tasks get dropped or shortchanged. But more often people steal from their personal time to get that work done, a sacrifice that research and practice have shown can lead to burnout and turnover - steep prices for both employees and organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of meetings, try scheduling alternative email or in-person check-ins to provide regular, substantive feedback. Only use meetings to collaborate and make decisions; avoid calling a meeting to relay information that could be explained in a memo or other company resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-encourage--collect-employee-input&quot;&gt;8. Encourage &amp;amp; Collect Employee Input&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171018---Blog-Assets8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees will only be motivated to express problems about their workplace - or the product - if they feel a manager will address the issue and encourage collective ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the psychology of the workplace, this is a difficult relationship for supervisors to cultivate, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a deep set of defense mechanisms that make us careful around people in authority positions,” James Detert, a professor at Cornell’s School of Management, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/10/how-to-get-your-employees-to-speak-up&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Harvard Business Review. “That is why the information you’re getting from people multiple levels below you in the organization is likely to be filtered.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you arrange regular group meetings or one-on-ones to address problem areas, the important thing is to establish a greater pattern of trust between management and workers - and a culture of ownership in the company at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Colleagues need to feel they have a stake in the success (or lack thereof) in the organization and that speaking up, admitting mistakes, and addressing concerns is a collective responsibility,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/10/how-to-get-your-employees-to-speak-up&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Rebecca Knight at HBR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key take-away here? If you want your employees to speak up, you’ll have to put in the work - but it’ll be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong workplace communication can make or break you - but getting it right doesn’t have to feel like such a mystery. Put this research to good use in the last quarter as you reexamine your management practices and strategize for a productive 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hubworks</name></author><summary type="html">Good communication in the workplace isn’t just about holding more efficient meetings or getting along with co-workers - it affects everything from productivity to employee engagement.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hubworks.com/Hubworks-171018---Blog-AssetsMain-Article-Image-copy.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">6 Different Management Styles (And How to Use Them)</title><link href="https://hubworks.com/6-management-styles.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="6 Different Management Styles (And How to Use Them)" /><published>2017-11-14T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-11-14T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://hubworks.com/different-management-styles-and-how-to-use-them</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hubworks.com/6-management-styles.html">&lt;p&gt;We all know that effective managers can make or break their team - and their company. Just think about the jobs you’ve had where you show up each day, energized and ready to work - and the ones where you dread clocking in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while CEOs and managers alike worry about employee retention in a competitive marketplace, odds are that &lt;a href=&quot;https://hubworks.com/16-employee-statistics-you-need-to-know.html&quot;&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to jump ship due to a conflict with management styles - not just because they received a better offer elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182321/employees-lot-managers.aspx&quot;&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Gallup, 50% of employees left their job because of leadership. The study also found that managers account for up to 70% of varying employee engagement. This should be a big takeaway for management, says Gallup CEO Jim Clifton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The single biggest decision you make in your job - bigger than all the rest - is who you name manager,” Clifton &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/why-do-people-really-quit-their-jobs-heres-the-entire-reason-summed-up-in-1-sent.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in the polling company’s annual review, “State of the American Workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you name the wrong person manager, nothing fixes that bad decision. Not compensation, not benefits - nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does an &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2005/03/what-great-managers-do&quot;&gt;effective manager&lt;/a&gt; look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An influential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/1838481/6-leadership-styles-and-when-you-should-use-them&quot;&gt;2000 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Daniel Goleman for Harvard Business Review surveyed 3,000 managers and executives across multiple sectors to determine six distinct management types. While the majority of these management styles have both strengths and weaknesses, some are far more effective than others at driving results or improving company morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the six classic management styles - and how you can use them effectively in your role:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-pacesetting&quot;&gt;1. Pacesetting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacesetting manager’s natural work environment in today’s economy would most likely be the tech start-up. These are the active, demanding, workhorse bosses who want you to deliver high-quality product on time - and in exactly the style they prefer. They seem to never sleep or go home, and the expectation might be that you should work this way, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech magnates Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were both known for these qualities. And while these visionaries may have driven the teams at Apple and Microsoft to monumental success, those close to the top most likely chafed under a heavy set of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over all, pacesetting bosses don’t leave much room for other viewpoints or alternative ways of achieving goals - they tend to view an “excellent performance” as exactly the kind of performance they would give themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to use this style: If your company is in crisis, or you’re helping a team weather a significant leadership transition, you may need to adopt this form of management style to move the needle and right the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to avoid this style: If used regularly, you may devalue the contributions of your employees - and wind up missing out on unique solutions to complicated problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-authoritative&quot;&gt;2. Authoritative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An authoritative manager makes employees sit up and pay attention. They envision a common goal or company-wide mission, and they see themselves as the leader who can help the team realize these intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times these big-picture thinkers can be wildly inspiring - though, like pacesetters, they are undoubtedly and absolutely in charge. When paired with teams that already have experienced subject-area experts, their visionary strengths can read as egotistical or overbearing rather than innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos have authoritative management styles, with singular visions for their companies. Ursula Burns, the CEO of Xerox, is a “direct” and “respectful” leader, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chip-conley/the-top-10-emotionallyint_b_911576.html&quot;&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, whose “assertiveness is matched by a sense of mission that inspires her employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to use this style: If your company needs a big vision to shape progress and can handle independence, you can afford to be the inspiring visionary - as long as you trust the other people on your team to deliver on the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to avoid this style: If your department heads are more knowledgeable or more experienced managers, it might be wise to let them have the floor, or cede to their expertise. Visionaries should know when to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-affiliative&quot;&gt;3. Affiliative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliative managers want their employees to feel like they’re “part of a family,” and they work hard to bond emotionally with employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the upside, this strategy can inspire employees to feel more connected to their workplace and to one another. But if too much emphasis is placed on emotional bonds, employees can lack the direction or meaningful feedback on performance they need to succeed - and the company as a whole may suffer from lack of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing illustrates the satirical extreme of this style better than fictional boss Michael Scott on The Office - he has a “world’s best dad” mug on his desk, and his employees at Dunder Mifflin barely sell a ream of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re looking for real-world examples, Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg is said to be both warm and approachable, while Sameer Dholakia, the CEO of SendGrid, was recently profiled by Forbes for his views on “servant leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At SendGrid, Dholakia strives to make meaningful connections with his employees and schedules plenty of free-form meetings where employees can give him feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll have no agenda. I just want to know how things are going,” Dholakia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/08/10/the-unusual-management-style-of-one-of-the-most-highly-rated-ceos-in-tech/#513d17a2715b&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Forbes. “I end just about every meeting with, ‘Is there anything I can do for you?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to use this style: If you need to build trust or morale within a department after a large transition, a round of layoffs, or budget cuts, it might be a good idea to put your people - rather than productivity - first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to avoid this style: On the whole, this is a bad long-term management style. Without constructive feedback, your employees won’t know how to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-coaching&quot;&gt;4. Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like its namesake, the coaching management style is interested in employee potential and improvement. These bosses actively identify the skills of their individual employees, and help them to improve those skills over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time-intensive management style may not work for all team members - and it’s difficult to pull off, too. In order to effectively coach your team, you should be a highly skilled manager who has earned the trust of your team or department. But if your employees just aren’t willing to be coached, you won’t make much headway with this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the creator of BlackRock, the largest money management firm on the planet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chip-conley/the-top-10-emotionallyint_b_911576.html&quot;&gt;Larry Fink&lt;/a&gt; shot to the top by encouraging his senior management team to improve their skillsets at emotional intelligence seminars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to use this style: If you have extensive leadership and management experience, this could be a great style to improve teamwork company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to avoid this style: This management approach doesn’t work with every employee - and it’s especially hard to pull off if you’re a new manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-coercive&quot;&gt;5. Coercive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coercive management style is often summed up as “do it my way, and do it now.” There’s no room for questioning here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the style might be a good way to lead your company in crisis - as long as you’re clear, direct, and firm - under just about any other circumstance, you’d grind employee morale to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to use this style: During crisis or emergency management, when the wrong move might cost jobs or lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to avoid this style: Under any other circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-democratic&quot;&gt;6. Democratic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171113---Blog-Assets6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The democratic manager is interested in building consensus. They want to give employees ample opportunity to weigh in on the decision-making process - which can be great if you need to generate company-wide buy-in for a mission shift or growth period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all democracies, however, change can be slow. Some managers may accidentally cede the chain of command - or muddy the waters for their employees - by trying to be too magnanimous and open-minded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has garnered plenty of attention for his management style. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/management-strategies-of-starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-2016-3&quot;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, the exec “recruits top performers and encourages them to step up and push back against his ideas when they don’t agree.” While it may be difficult to say what happens next around that particular table, democratic managers are as interested in points of contention as they are in finding common ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to use this style: If you need employees to feel like they have ownership over a long-term plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to avoid this style: Some decisions simply need to be made by equals. If your employees are not senior enough to contribute to company policy or directional shifts, a democratic approach may not yield sustainable results. If this is the case, ask for input and feedback, rather than trying to build consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you most likely gravitate toward one management style over another quite naturally, remember: it’s possible to consciously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/guides/201105/how-to-change-your-management-style.html&quot;&gt;change your management style&lt;/a&gt; to be more effective for your team. As long as you’re being reflective, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/09/09/5-things-the-best-managers-do-and-dont-do/&quot;&gt;open to feedback&lt;/a&gt;, and willing to learn, you’ll gain the strengths of a seasoned leader, no matter which style - or range of styles - you adopt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hubworks</name></author><summary type="html">We all know that effective managers can make or break their team - and their company.

But with the best candidates &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.workconnect.io/2017/08/18/2017-state-hr-recruiting-united-states/&quot;&gt;off the market within 10 days and 95% of HR professionals feeling urgency and pressure to fill roles&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no wonder the onboarding process can seem rushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/adam-vaccaro/voluntary-turnover-six-months.html&quot;&gt;40% of employees leaving within the first 6 months&lt;/a&gt; at a new company, a thorough onboarding process could be one of the most important things standing between your team and a costly turnover rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a study from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/onboarding-key-retaining-engaging-talent.aspx&quot;&gt;Wynhurst Group&lt;/a&gt;, employees are “58 percent more likely to still be at the company three years later if they had completed a structured onboarding process.” Company culture and clear opportunities for growth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/adam-vaccaro/voluntary-turnover-six-months.html&quot;&gt;play an outsized role in whether an employee decides to stay&lt;/a&gt;, too - which means the onboarding process can make or break your team’s productivity and retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to re-boot your onboarding process for new hires? Here are a few best practices to keep in mind throughout the hiring and training process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-create-resources&quot;&gt;1. Create Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboarding a new team member happens long before they clock in on their first day. Whether this is a new position or a well-established role in the company, make sure your new hire has access to the resources they need to find their way around the office and succeed in their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-they-arrive&quot;&gt;Before They Arrive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduce your new hire to your team via email before they arrive, providing a bit of background or even stand-out sections from their application. Providing context on your new hire for your team will also help team members connect, trust, and work with the new guy that much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;around-the-office&quot;&gt;Around the Office&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do to make your new hire’s first day at the office easier? From an IT standpoint, make sure their email account is set up, and that their computer has all the software it needs. Do you have a futzy copier or copier codes to worry about? What about security clearances or passwords other employees may now take for granted? Don’t forget to think about employee comfort, too - tips on how to navigate parking near the office or a list of favorite lunch spots will make your new hire feel welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-few-weeks&quot;&gt;The First Few Weeks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a managerial standpoint, it’s crucial to get your team member ready to go in their role as quickly as possible. Don’t just leave a packet of forms from HR on their desk (though you should have these ready, too.) Develop an initial work plan and schedule, and make sure you build out more time in your day to check in on your new hire, formally or informally. Remember: other people can be resources, too. Whether you assign your new hire an “office buddy” or a full-fledged mentor, use the other members of your team to help you with your training objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-welcome-your-new-team-member&quot;&gt;2. Welcome Your New Team Member&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be the tech start-up that takes new hires mountain climbing or the nonprofit that schedules a volunteer day. Even something as simple as a team lunch can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/3-key-employee-onboarding-tactics-for-an-employees-first-days&quot;&gt;help employees get acclimated to their new workplace and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;here-are-a-few-welcoming-tactics-to-try&quot;&gt;Here are a few welcoming tactics to try:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cubicle Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a welcoming workspace. Go the extra mile by including a nameplate, business cards, a calendar, or a stress ball - anything that’s personal, functional, and recalls your company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get-to-Know-You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you walk your new hire through the office, make introductions; alternatively, schedule a staff meeting to showcase your new team member. A team-building lunch or other activity can be a great way for new folks to get to know their co-workers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proud of your product or service? Make sure to gift your new hire with company swag so they feel like a part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-set-expectations-for-work-and-management-style&quot;&gt;3. Set Expectations for Work and Management Style&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If new hires bail on a company within the first 6-12 months, it’s often because there was no clear explanation of their role - or they determined there was little room to grow and develop new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your employee’s first few weeks of work include opportunities to meet measurable short-term goals, as well as discussions about skills development and future training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly outline expectations. Go beyond the job description. Give your new employee a sense of expectations and responsibilities, as well as any potential pathways for growth within the company. Plenty of these questions were likely ironed out during the hiring process, but it’s a good opportunity for your new hire to ask in more detail.
Identify goals and a workplan. What projects can your new hire tackle right now? Which team can they join or add to? What does their job look like one month from now? Three months? Six months?
Remember to check in. Training a new hire is intense for everyone involved - including the manager! You’ll have to make more time in your schedule for regular check-ins, meetings, and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-assign-a-buddy-or-mentor&quot;&gt;4. Assign a Buddy or Mentor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/employee-mentorship-program&quot;&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;, mentorship is a clear predictor of career success - and can increase retention, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the buddy is a peer who can help your new hire navigate the office, or a seasoned professional who can help your new hire grow into their role, building a supportive network for new hires increases retention and fast-tracks productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need some ideas for an informal or formal mentorship program? Here are a few starting points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monthly meetings with a mentor to discuss roles and growth
Informal check-ins with peer mentors or office buddies
Direct management from supervisor, who is highly engaged with new hire during first three months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-plan-for-training-and-development&quot;&gt;5. Plan for Training and Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hubworks.com/blog/50-employee-engagement-ideas/&quot;&gt;Employee engagement&lt;/a&gt; is the industry buzzword from the past few years - but this elusive idea is still key to happiness and retention. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2015/07/20/8-key-tactics-for-developing-employees/&amp;amp;refURL=&amp;amp;referrer=#274b85716373&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, only 30% of employees feel engaged in their work, and 82% of companies have a plan to further train or develop employees to increase their engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What concrete steps will your company actually take to help employees develop their skills - and how can you fold this into your onboarding process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provide a roadmap for growth at the company. Is there a clear path for your new hire, in terms of more responsibility or promotion? If there’s not a role they can grow into, what other training or professional development opportunities can you offer?
Take a skills inventory. Did you hire a video editor who’s also an incredible graphic designer? What about a grant writer who has a knack for publicity? Whatever your new hire’s skills happen to be, find ways for them to flex their muscles in their new role.
Outline new opportunities. What training is available within the company? What partnerships or other opportunities does your company cultivate for its employees?
Encourage employees to collaborate. New hires are often exciting to work with because they look at your company differently, and they bring their own set of experiences and resources. What kinds of cross-team collaborations or opportunities does your new hire see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-provide-and-gather-feedback&quot;&gt;6. Provide and Gather Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubworks-171017---Blog-Assets6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the first three months, make sure to sit down with your new hire for a formal or informal review. Detailed feedback about their performance, tied to concrete annual review metrics, should give them a sense of how they’re stacking up so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;as-with-any-review-make-sure-you&quot;&gt;As with any review, make sure you:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on positives.&lt;/strong&gt; What projects or tasks did your new hire knock out of the park? Thoughtfully identify areas for continued growth. At what points did you notice they needed extra support?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address challenges.&lt;/strong&gt; If your new hire experiences challenges in their role, give them time and space to reflect. Why was the task difficult? What other resources did they need? How was their time-management? What could have happened differently?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide opportunities for feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; Collect a self-reflection before the review, so you have more time to consider concrete solutions that address problem areas. Thoughtful employees may even provide feedback that can help you think through the very nature of their role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make yourself available for questions.&lt;/strong&gt; New hires deserve an open-door policy. Decide what yours will be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-personalize-it&quot;&gt;7. Personalize It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company culture is different - make sure your onboarding process feels unique to your company and brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a lifestyle company or tech start-up, consider a fun way to involve your product in the onboarding process, or send your new hire home with a bag of sample merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does your company handle teamwork? Competition? Give a new hire a sense of your corporate culture by incorporating team-building activities or low-key competitions and games. Even a field day or short hike can give new employees a chance to have fun, let loose, and get to know their co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a mission-based company that believes in giving back? Embrace your corporate giving statement for a day by volunteering with a community partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a manager’s standpoint, onboarding is a never-ending process. There’s always something you’ll want to do better or differently during your next search. By developing a clear, organized, friendly training program that makes new employees feel welcomed, valued, and poised to succeed in the company, you’ll be going a long way toward making your new hires satisfied and comfortable in their new roles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hubworks</name></author><summary type="html">Too often, all that’s involved in the onboarding process for new hires is a quick orientation, a packet of information, and a new nameplate on a desk. But with the best candidates off the market within 10 days and 95% of HR professionals feeling urgency and pressure to fill roles, it’s no wonder the onboarding process can seem rushed.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hubworks.com/Hubworks-171017---Blog-AssetsMain-Article-Image-copy.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">High Restaurant Turnover? Here’s What You Can Do to Turn It Around</title><link href="https://hubworks.com/reduce-restaurant-employee-turnover.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="High Restaurant Turnover? Here’s What You Can Do to Turn It Around" /><published>2017-10-04T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2017-10-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://hubworks.com/reduce-restaurant-employee-turnover</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hubworks.com/reduce-restaurant-employee-turnover.html">&lt;p&gt;No restaurateur likes to think or talk about the turnover in their restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, we’re going to do just that. Why? Because the restaurant turnover rate is 72.9%. If you ask us, that’s unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 1 million restaurant locations in the United States, your highest-performing staff members have plenty of places to work. Let’s go over some ways you can keep them at your restaurant instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-schedules&quot;&gt;Flexible Schedules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurant scheduling is a fickle part of the job. Unlike the 9-5 life of day job employees, restaurant employees could work anywhere from 20-80 hours per week and never have the same schedule twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some employees perceive this as exciting, others get frustrated with unmet time-off requests and feel a strong sense of FOMO when asked to work during a special occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these employees feel too overwhelmed, some decide to call it quits, raising your turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this, understand the need for a work-life balance in your restaurant. Don’t schedule the same server for the Friday night shift every week unless they ask for it, and consider offering on-call shifts for those who volunteer for them. Giving employees choice of their hours lets them feel control over their job (and less likely to relinquish that control).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-regular-progress-meetings&quot;&gt;Have Regular Progress Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, this is reserved for more private sector or office jobs. But seeing as that turnover rate is less than 50%, maybe it’s not such a bad idea to start hosting performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-shift meetings allow quieter people’s thoughts to go unspoken, so one-on-ones can be a better opportunity to talk. These can be formal, periodic meetings in your back office with feedback from peers and managers, or they can be informal check-ins that occur as-needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structured or not, these meetings open the door between employer and employee communication so both parties can express concerns and aspirations over the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offer-advancement-opportunities&quot;&gt;Offer Advancement Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to restaurant consultant Donald Burns, one of the top reasons restaurants lose staff is because there’s no opportunity for advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let this be the case in your restaurant! Be open with your staff about what the road looks like for promotions, pay raises, and career advancement. When the expectations are clear, they’ll be more likely to stay in your restaurant to attain that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bring-on-more-experienced-managers&quot;&gt;Bring On More Experienced Managers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with a long career in hospitality and with good references should naturally be given precedence in the job selection process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two factors keeping the entire industry turnover so high are the seasonality of worker availability and the young age of many employees. With a bulk of the restaurant workforce still in school, high turnover is clearly tied to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To account for the ins-and-outs of high school bussers, place experience and industry longevity towards the top of your hiring criteria for management and leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exit-interviews&quot;&gt;Exit Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic moments of “I quit!” are for the movies. Normally, you’ll get some sort of heads up if an employee is on their way out. Take some time to meet with them if they’re leaving and ask for candid feedback about what’s working well in the restaurant and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, when someone isn’t in fear of losing their job, he or she probably isn’t afraid to speak some truths. If you hear some recurring themes from departing employees, use the insight to take action and make your restaurant a better place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encourage-feedback&quot;&gt;Encourage Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants should not be dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While owners and managers must give direction, your cooks are the ones making the food and your servers are the ones on the floor. These people play as much a role in a given shift that you do. Make sure your restaurant is an open forum for new ideas, constructive criticism, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When employees feel like their voices are heard and see their ideas implemented, they’ll know they have a valued spot in your restaurant and will be less inclined to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-tech-that-makes-tipping-easy&quot;&gt;Use Tech That Makes Tipping Easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read up on the topic of reducing employee turnover before, chances are someone said the solution to reducing turnover is simple – just pay better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only it were that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better tipping methods let owners spend less on wages while employees make more. Customer-facing terminals at QSRs and restaurant handhelds at FSRs with pre-prompted tip amounts can increase gratuities 3x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get real for a moment – people really only work so that they can make money. If this tech results in more money for employees, why would they work somewhere else and make less money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hire-smarter&quot;&gt;Hire Smarter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hiring process (posting jobs, interviewing, and planning for onboarding) is restaurant’s chance to make a professional impression. When you simply wing it, you could see fewer qualified candidates, ask the wrong interview questions, or set unclear expectations when following up with an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the process of a step-by-step restaurant hiring kit simplifies the process for everyone involved – employees and candidates alike, as sloppy hiring tends to set poor standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reducing-restaurant-turnover&quot;&gt;Reducing Restaurant Turnover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants need to do everything in their power as the industry becomes more competitive and the war for talent rages on. More communication before, during, and after someone’s time working for your restaurant can make the job easier for everyone involved and more profitable for the business.&lt;/p&gt;

Losing highly qualified employees means losing the productivity and talent they brought to the table. It means conducting time-consuming interviews. It means training and onboarding new hires. It means waiting the months or years it takes for a new person to reach the level of impact that their predecessor achieved in that same position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process can sometimes bring even greater talent into your organization. But almost without exception, replacing a competent employee costs more than keeping them around. The question is what your business can do to keep top-quality talent on your payroll. Here are eight employee retention strategies you can implement right now to boost your company’s employee retention rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-revamp-your-hiring-process&quot;&gt;1. Revamp your hiring process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving your company’s employee retention rate is only worthwhile if your employees are worth retaining. If you are hiring the wrong people, you are either going to have to fire them or they are going to leave of their own accord. Either way, you will be back to square one. The first step toward employee retention is shoring up your hiring and screening processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an interview process with two or three stages of interviews instead of one. Use reference checks and skill tests to assess qualifications and culture fit. And sit down and sketch out a consistent and comprehensive background check policy that includes criminal history checks and verifications of education, past employment, and professional licenses. These steps will help you hire the right person the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-look-at-your-benefits-package&quot;&gt;2. Look at your benefits package&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salary and benefits are the elephants in the room during any conversation about employee turnover and retention. If your business can offer higher salaries, doing so will certainly help attract and retain top talent. If not, try to get creative with your benefits package. For instance, offering telecommuting, flextime, and creative time off options will all boost work/life balance—often a huge factor for employee retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-get-rid-of-micromanagers&quot;&gt;3. Get rid of micromanagers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad hires are a top cause of employee turnover, but if you are losing good people left and right, you need to look at the managers. If many of your recent departures came from one department, there’s probably a correlation. Micromanagers are poison for employee retention. Team leaders who strand their employees in meetings all day or send strings of emails to “check on progress” are well-meaning, but they often kill productivity and make their direct reports feel disrespected and disempowered. If a manager’s helicopter tendencies are driving talented employees to the exit, it might be time to reconsider that person’s value to your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-ask-existing-employees-what-you-can-do-to-improve-the-work-environment&quot;&gt;4. Ask existing employees what you can do to improve the work environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out why employees are leaving, the best people to ask are your employees. Do exit interviews with ex-employees to find out what drove them to search for new opportunities, or ask existing employees what you can do to improve the work environment. You will hear a slew of responses spanning every possible category from management to air quality to décor. Take these comments into consideration when brainstorming ways to make your business a better place to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-emphasize-company-culture&quot;&gt;5. Emphasize company culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many job seekers today aren’t just looking for a job and a paycheck. They want to feel excited about coming into work every day. Company culture is a big piece of that. If the atmosphere of the office encourages socialization, teamwork, innovation, and creativity, that’s a bigger draw than an office where no one talks to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people you hire and the friendships they form are going to establish the culture of the office. You may not have direct control over these factors, but you can create an atmosphere in which office friendships are encouraged. Look for opportunities to get employees together for social activities outside of work, and try to create a unified company vision that everyone can care about. The more connected your employees feel to your business and the people who work there, the less likely they are to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-offer-ongoing-learning-and-training-opportunities&quot;&gt;6. Offer ongoing learning and training opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People want to feel valued by their employers. They also want to feel like they are growing professionally at a steady clip. Emphasizing learning, training, and employee development within your organization kills two birds with one stone. Footing the bill for employee learning opportunities shows that you are invested in their success. Employees who are consistently picking up new skills or leadership abilities feel like they have real momentum in their jobs. Both factors improve employee satisfaction and reduce restlessness, ultimately helping with retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-reward-quality-work-and-performance&quot;&gt;7. Reward quality work and performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of making your employees feel valued, it’s important to recognize and reward high-quality work. Regarding monetary rewards, you can’t ignore or withhold raises or bonuses when they are truly deserved just to cut corners. If your business is doing well and there are a few people who have helped you get there, you need to recognize that. However, monetary rewards are not the only way to recognize quality performance. Employee of the month programs or gamification can foster healthy competition within your team. These programs push people to work harder, improve the overall quality of work, and make your top talent feel valued and validated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-schedule-regular-reviews&quot;&gt;8. Schedule regular reviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While micromanaging is undoubtedly a bad thing, that doesn’t mean “no management” is the right solution. Managers should plan to meet with employees for regular one-on-one sessions (usually monthly or every few weeks) and should schedule reviews on a quarterly basis. Regular one-on-ones give managers a chance to check in on employees without smothering them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarterly reviews give workers the opportunity to set new goals, propose new learning and development opportunities, and raise any grievances they may have. These meetups keep the lines of communication open and make sure everyone is on the same page, eliminating much of the confusion and frustration that often leads to employee turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are never going to have an office where no one leaves. People retire. They move away. They go back to school. They decide to start families and cut back on work. However, by emphasizing employee retention, your company can eliminate many of the departures that truly are avoidable. Implementing the eight strategies described above is a perfect way to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hubworks</name></author><summary type="html">It’s no secret that employee turnover is expensive.

Provide workers with flexible scheduling options! Allow more remote work! Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a retail outlet with specific, well-established needs regarding shift coverage, how do you attract and retain the right kind of worker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bloomberg, employee retention is one of the biggest problems the retail sector faces. As rates soar to 5% per month, frequent employee turnover can cost retailers as much as $3,400 per employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have strict needs for shift coverage, it’s possible to create a scheduling practice that’s fair, transparent, and predictable for all your employees – making them happier and more productive to boot. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-be-predictable&quot;&gt;1. Be Predictable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether they’re “on call” or waiting for managers to post schedules, 17% of retail workers have unstable work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There were days I would work 48 hours in a row,” Tia Raynor, a former retail employee at Portland International Airport, told Vox. “Then I would go to my other job and sleep for an hour or two in parking lot. When that was done I would sleep for another hour or two and then go back to the coffee shop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This instability makes it difficult for employees like Raynor to plan for child care, family vacations, and other everyday needs, leading to greater dissatisfaction in the workplace, lower productivity, and higher turnover – all of which cost you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the interview process, make it clear to your new hires what your scheduling needs are. Of course, those needs should be realistic and grounded in data. Don’t just assume your weekend mornings will be swamped – use the predictive capabilities of your POS to forecast sales and foot traffic based on past transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you develop a workable shift calendar, stick to it, giving employees plenty of notice if you plan to change what an average shift looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-work-ahead&quot;&gt;2. Work Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In states like California, New York, and Massachusetts, on-call scheduling practices from major retailers have led to lawsuits – and it’s easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice puts an incredible amount of pressure on employees to make themselves available during their down time, leads to uncertainty about income, strains employee-manager relations, and, at worst, can violate state labor laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Forbes, New York City Council members introduced legislation in 2016 to ban on-call scheduling practices altogether and advocated workers have at least two weeks’ advance notice of their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid potentially sticky situations by posting your schedule 3 to 4 weeks in advance. Make your scheduling decisions based on a variety of input: employee interaction, specific shift needs, and shift data you’ve collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making data-driven decisions, you’ll be able to put your best salespeople on the floor when you need them most. Forecasting will help you become more effective at anticipating your store’s needs, and cut down on labor costs, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-make-transparency-a-goal&quot;&gt;3. Make Transparency a Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days of paper schedules made during your spare moments in the back office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use new technology to design shift calendar templates and share schedules automatically with your employees, making the scheduling process transparent and easy to navigate. A commitment to scheduling transparency also helps visibly align your business with labor laws, especially when it comes to overtime and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As start-ups and service industries have uncovered, transparent businesses also inspire more trust in their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Harvard Business Review surveyed 550 business leaders from a range of industries. 70% of respondents indicated their employees stay more engaged when they’re keyed into decision-making, including how their roles help the company meet its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparent scheduling may be a best practice for small retailers – but it can translate to a wider company culture that keeps your employees happy, engaged, and productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-encourage-employee-communication&quot;&gt;4. Encourage Employee Communication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get bogged down in vacation requests or shift changes. Use scheduling software to encourage employees to communicate with one another, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens the pathways of communication for retail workers, especially in an industry that offers fewer opportunities for employees to get to know – or depend on – one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In an office environment, you can rely on co-workers who work at the same time as you, but the shift environment is constantly changing,” Austin Vedder, the creator of Shift Messenger, told TechCrunch.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At Redbeacon, we had Gmail, Slack, Asana, a Path group, Gchat, but in a retail environment you are dependent on those three or four people on your smartphone list,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of new scheduling apps offers retail employees greater ease of communication. This shifts the burden away from your scheduling manager and frees up more of their time to solve pressing staff- or sales-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-invite-feedback&quot;&gt;5. Invite Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make yourself regularly available for employee feedback on the shift schedule. Before you run away in terror, know that the feedback process doesn’t have to be extensive – or contentious – to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, think of seeking feedback as a manager’s opportunity to check in regularly with their employees and build positive relationships. Multiple studies have found that, when given opportunities to be more engaged at work, employees are happier and more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid being sidetracked by grievances or accused of favoritism, give your employees a framework for response. Try an anonymous survey, or a 15-minute all-employee sit-down with a structured question-and-answer session to see what kind of insights your employees have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your staff culture, responses in writing can be most effective, suggests Raphael Crawford-Marks at Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If employees have the freedom to voice their views in writing, they might take more care in crafting what they say, especially if it will be public,” writes Crawford-Marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it clear to your employees that you look forward to using their responses to improve scheduling – then share with them your plan to make good on your promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-make-data-driven-decisions&quot;&gt;6. Make Data-Driven Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aiming for transparency and inviting feedback are human needs-driven management goals. But data about foot traffic and sales volume can – and should – inform your decision-making, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one study of a women’s apparel retailer showed, common scheduling pitfalls, like overstaffing during slow periods or vice versa, can eat away at labor costs and frustrate customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Saravanan Kesavan and his co-authors found that all of the stores were understaffed significantly during the peak periods of the day, while they were significantly overstaffed during the rest of the hours,” reports Ethan Bernstein at Harvard Business Review. “The authors estimated that the retailer was losing about 9% of sales and 7% of profits due to this mismatch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-offer-incentives&quot;&gt;7. Offer Incentives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other sectors, retail doesn’t always offer its employees a clear pathway for growth and promotion, beyond advancing to managerial positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can make it difficult for part-time and temporary workers to stay engaged during their shift – even if there’s plenty of work that needs doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you schedule, make your goals for individual employees – or individual roles within your store – apparent for the shift. This should include mentorship and training opportunities for new employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No employee onboarding program should be completed without providing trainees with an experienced mentor that can help them enhance their customer service skills in real time — during those crucial first few days on the store floor,” Sabrina Son writes for TINYPulse, an employee engagement platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding creative responsibilities for your best workers can be a good way to engage employees and enliven shifts, too – especially if you take the time to acknowledge employees for their hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you take the time to notice the good, people will work harder to earn more of that acknowledgment,” a spokesperson for TSheets told Square. “At the end of the day, every single person just wants someone to believe in them. They want to be respected. Be the manager who respects them and be the manager who gets their best effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-revisit-your-track-record&quot;&gt;8. Revisit Your Track Record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make time each month – or each quarter – to check in on your scheduling practices and your employee satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are your scheduling efforts being received? How has this translated to employee productivity, engagement, and retention?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compile any feedback from your records, including conversations with your employees, to make small tweaks to scheduling, training, and onboarding, so your entire HR department keeps improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fold these records into any meetings you might have between shift managers and upper management, to ensure all the leaders at your store are striving to maintain the same company culture and meet employee retention benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

As this form of customer engagement increases, retail marketing teams must become ever more effective at capturing a customer’s interest online and funneling it into a store visit that results in a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you make and set marketing goals across multiple channels? In this age of omnichannel analytics, what does a good marketing benchmark look like for brick-and-mortar retailers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting and tracking clear, measurable small business marketing KPIs can help you better understand the online-to-offline conversions that drive your business – and your bottom line. If you’ve been unsure about how to utilize your customer data to drive marketing decisions, we have the primer you need to improve your advertising online and boost sales to boot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Foot Traffic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foot traffic is an important performance indicator for any brick-and-mortar retailer, but there’s more you can do to evaluate how effective SEO and keyword searches are at driving online visitors to your store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already invested in PPC with Google AdWords, take advantage of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://econsultancy.com/blog/67038-11-ways-to-track-online-to-offline-conversions-and-vice-versa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; in-store visit estimates &lt;/a&gt;. Google calculates these numbers by syncing Google Maps data with the number of clicks generated by your ads. The estimates will give you a rough idea of how many people are likely to visit your store after engaging with an ad – but you’ll need to run actual foot traffic data to get the real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjust your copy, timing, and messaging to improve the success of your campaigns, setting specific benchmarks once you have a good baseline to work from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to track: Use Google AdWords data to estimate how many of your PPC ads lead to store visits. Paired with beacons or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sapanalytics.cloud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; location analytics software &lt;/a&gt; – which provide both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-retailers-track-shoppers-in-heat-maps-2014-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; heat mapping &lt;/a&gt; and foot traffic data – in your retail space, you should be able to calculate the lift associated with a specific online campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Phone Calls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For marketing principal Troy Spring, who works in the automotive space, phone calls are still an incredibly important metric, even though it might seem like old hat in the age of big data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By narrowing down and focusing on some old-school metrics, such as how many people walked through the door and how many times the phone rang, we are able to generate more leads and sales because [we] are spending time analyzing the closing, appointment ratios and the performance of the sales team rather than worrying about the bounce rate of the home page,” Spring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/02/08/the-five-core-kpis-for-brick-and-mortar-retail-businesses/&amp;amp;refURL=http://hubworks.com/blog/small-business-marketing-kpis/&amp;amp;referrer=http://hubworks.com/blog/small-business-marketing-kpis/#4f05e7505bbf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; explained &lt;/a&gt; at Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re already tracking phone calls – and how often these calls convert to sales – you’re on the right path. Take it one step further by analyzing how many mobile keyword searches for your business result in customer calls. This way you’ll be able to tweak your SEO or PPC strategies to drive search traffic and phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://econsultancy.com/blog/64395-google-click-to-call-used-by-more-than-40-of-mobile-searchers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; 94% of customers need &lt;/a&gt; to call a retailer to get more general information about a product or business. Use the keyword searches that help them find you online to your advantage in future campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to track: Call tracking software – or Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://econsultancy.com/blog/64395-google-click-to-call-used-by-more-than-40-of-mobile-searchers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; click-to-call function &lt;/a&gt; – will help you get a sense of how many keyword searches result in calls to your store. If you want to encourage more calls or customer engagement, adjust ads and mobile CTAs to make it easier for customers to call your location. And be sure to train your staff on telephone customer service to improve the overall customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Mobile Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve already launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hubworks.com/leverage-location-analytics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; mobile marketing strategy &lt;/a&gt; or your store is just beginning to experiment with beacon-triggered ads, customer engagement provides incredible insight into the success of your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to digital marketer Joe Scartz, mobile campaigns – including SMS offers prompted by beacons – are most successful when they’re folded into your overall marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Done in isolation, [mobile ad campaigns] will not be nearly as effective as they might if you take the time to map out personalized and relevant content via coherent cross-channel integrations and proximity marketing,” Scartz writes at Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more personalized your offers, the more effective your marketing team will be at engaging mobile customers and transforming interest into sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to track: KPIs here include your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tune.com/blog/bag-kpis-retail-app-engagement-retention/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; customer retention and conversion rates &lt;/a&gt;, as well as lifetime user values for customers who provide mobile data. Track these data points to see what makes your customers click – and what makes them stay loyal to your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Time to First Visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your marketing team probably already tracks how well your business performs in keyword searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gain even more insight into the success of your SEO by tracking the amount of time that lags between a customer’s initial web search and their store visit. This requires installing geofencing hardware, like beacons, or location-analytics software to tag and track individual customer data and how those customers respond to targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The closer to the store, the higher the conversion rate [for targeted ads] and the lower the cost per exposure,” explains Mark Traphagen at MarketingLand.com. “Past five miles, there is typically little to no lift in local store visits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traphagen recommends aiming for a more targeted – that is, a more personal and relevant – approach, rather than relying on a customer’s proximity to do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to track: Use geofencing and mobile marketing to target customers with highly personalized discounts and content – then track how long it takes them to respond to your offer. While individual campaigns may only increase foot traffic slightly over the course of a few days, your aim should be to decrease the amount of time between a customer’s exposure to your offer and their decision to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Online Review Growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, online engagement is important. But likes, clicks, and shares on social media don’t exactly translate into revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online review growth, on the other hand, gives you more insight into how many customers are purchasing your products. Accurately gauge customer satisfaction with your products and services while driving customer loyalty – all by providing a simple platform for engagement and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlascpas.com/review-generation-the-quickest-way-to-business-growth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; 79% of customers say online reviews influence their purchasing decisions &lt;/a&gt;, encouraging customer reviews becomes one of the best marketing strategies in your arsenal. Reviews convert customers – it’s just that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, customer reviews can actually help more potential customers find your business online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fresh, product-specific review content drives search traffic and keyword rankings, specifically when a business earns 10 or more reviews – resulting in 15-20% increase in search traffic,” explains Emily Cullinan at the BigCommerce blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re trying to improve your cross-platform engagement, capturing the right kind of traffic – and the right kind of customer – is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about how you can encourage better online reviews &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quicksprout.com/2015/10/05/5-techniques-to-get-5-stars-how-to-get-more-and-better-online-reviews/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to track: Beyond day-to-day reputation management, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/retail/how-to-encourage-customer-reviews-and-why-you-should&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; design campaigns to incentivize customer reviews &lt;/a&gt;. Track how often – and by whom – your offer is redeemed. If you’re marketing a specific product, spend some time analyzing the conversion rates of product reviews to get a better sense of ROI on ad spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Stock Turn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing and tracking inventory is one thing, but tying your stock turnover to sales and marketing efforts is a whole other ball game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How quickly your stock turns can be a surefire indicator of how well your marketing campaigns – from online to in-store advertising – are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you have a high rate of product return, you’re probably picking up on a disconnect between customer expectations and product quality or usability – which could mean it’s time to rethink your sales and marketing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have a product that requires more explanation or a finer touch from a floor salesman. Maybe you can improve your in-store displays for this product – or your online product photos – to help move the item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you sell products online, be prepared for free shipping and lax return policies to complicate inventory turnover rates – and potentially eat into your profit. Prevent this from happening to you by reading this helpful guide from Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to track: Calculate your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/102947142-how-to-reduce-your-return-rate-predict-exactly-what-customers-want&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; product return rate &lt;/a&gt; and your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/kpi-examples/supply-chain/inventory-turnover&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; inventory turnover &lt;/a&gt;. Regularly share this data with your marketing team to help inform product-specific campaigns and time general campaigns more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Transactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/small-business-marketing-kpis-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;small-business-marketing-kpis-7&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know you’re keeping an eye on your store’s sales. But tracking your sale count, or number of transactions, can give you so much more information – including how well your in-store and mobile marketing campaigns are working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the conversion rate for your mobile offers? How often do customers return to make purchases? What’s your average lifetime value?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, for retail outlets, even successful mobile campaigns mean little if the in-store customer experience fails to delight or inform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While sales promotions, point events, and other in-store shopping events are the low-hanging fruit to bringing buyers in,” John William Barger, business development consultant for Saks Fifth Avenue, tells the Vend blog, “at the end of the day, the sales staff needs to be trained to be always available, always listening, and anticipating each customer’s needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
